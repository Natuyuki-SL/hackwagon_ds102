    "LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having just joined their Data Science team, your first project is to help LendingClub prepare a prediction model to help them detect loan defaulters. Before attempting to create a model, you would first have to understand data you're working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having already conducted the initial data preprocessing (in PS1), your project manager, Silver, wants you to further analyse the data, this time on larger sample (`loans-200k.csv`). Based on your initial investigation, you've found out that the number of default loans is dependent on the grade of the loan. However, you believe that this analysis is insufficient, therefore you will be exploring several visualisation techniques to aid you in your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset handed to you are loans issued through 2007 - 2015 period including loan status. A data dictionary (`LCDataDictionary`) is also provided for you to get a better understanding of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This problem set tackles both <b>Data Preprocessing and Descriptive Analytics</b> stages of the Data Science project.  "
